# 👋👋👋 *greetings bored students...*

## 🎮🎮 if you're here for the **unblo(cked games**, then the **links are at the bottom** 🎮🎮



🛎️ If you want me to make you an unbloc(ked version of a website, DM me on Discord! My discord is  fire#9999

Here are my ***reposted*** game's links:

[Regular Games](https://fire-9999.github.io/boredhtml) - CREDIT GOES TO BOREDHTML INC. ([Github Profile](https://github.com/PiSaucer/boredhtml))  |||  
[Gameboy Games](https://fire-9999.github.io/gb) - CREDIT GOES TO NABILAFK ([Github Profile](https://github.com/nabilafk)) 
**please note only the games on the left collumn work in all schools, some schools may block everything in the middle/right collumns**

## if any github creators have problems or issues with me reposting their sites, DM me on Discord. I'm  much more active there.

### if you see any weird symbols in my typing, it's so the school doesn't find the website suspicious by looking at hotwords such as 'unblo)cked g(ames' next to each other, just in case.
